    "Fun fact: Every employee at the University of Illinois is a \"public employee\" and all public employee salaries are [publicly available online](https://www.bot.uillinois.edu/resources/gray_book) -- we have curated this data in a cleaned dataset for you to explore!  This includes data about every professor, administrator, and football coach!\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this lab is to work with **real UIUC salary data** to explore its properties, answer important questions, and to think about the implications of collecting and analyzing this data.  Throughout the lab, it is important to think about being a critical consumer of data who can not only use statistics and programming to analyze data, but can also think about the **\"why\"** part of data science both in the classroom and in the world. Let’s get started!\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will:\n",
    "- Work with real UIUC salary data to explore some of the statistics that we talked about in lecture: mean, median, standard deviation, etc.\n",
    "- Practice creating plots to **visualize quantitative data**: boxplots and histograms.\n",
    "- See how data science can be used in the real world to think about important issues through written individual reflections and discussions with your group.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few tips to remember:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **You are not alone on your journey in learning programming!**  You have your lab TA, the CAs, your lab group, and the professors (Prof. Wade and Prof. Karle), who are all here to help you out!\n",
    "- If you find yourself stuck for more than a few minutes, ask a neighbor or course staff for help!  When you are giving help to your neighbor, explain the **idea and approach** to the problem without sharing the answer itself so they can have the same **<i>ah-hah</i>** moment!\n",

    "The people that benefit from collecting data like salaries of faculty benefits students and the general public in order for there to be transparancy of how much a professor or faculty member is being paid. There are some cons such as this being public and maybe the staff do not like the fact that this information is public. It can pose a threat to their safety just because someone knows how much money they make. I think this data is public as it could help someone who is looking for a job to compare salaries between different places or compare salaries between characteristics such as gender to identify any problems or disparities between staff. When we looked at the salaries stratified by gender, I genuinely thought there would be a gap between salaries but that was not the case. In cases where there might be reasons to question something, public data allows answers to those questions!"
