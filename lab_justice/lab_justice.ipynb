    "We plan on continuing to explore simulation in Python this week. However, this time, we're going to simulate some **real-world events** that have actually happened in the past.  The goal is for you to see how we can use data science to think about issues of **equity** and **social justice**.  As usual, in addition to coding, we want you to get practice having **discussions about the data science** you're doing and think about how data science can be a useful tool that can help you in your future job and as a citizen.\n",

    "# Part 1: Jury Selection + Simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "The 6th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution provides the right to an **“impartial jury”** in criminal prosecutions, but what exactly does this mean? The Supreme Court has said that juries must be drawn from a representative cross-section of the community. In other words, juries should be **randomly selected** from the eligible population. However, there are many instances in history where it doesn’t seem like this was the case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take for example, the case of Berghuis v. Smith.  In 1993, Smith (a Black man) was convicted of 2nd-degree murder by an **all-white** jury and sentenced to life in prison. The jury was selected from a panel of about 100 randomly selected people. Only 3 of them were Black and none of those 3 made it into the final 37 considered for Smith’s trial. The county population was approximately 8 percent Black at the time of the trial.  Remember, jury panels are supposed to be selected at random from the eligible population.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis: Your Initial Thoughts\n",
    "**Group Discussion: Because 8% of the eligible population was Black, 3 Black people on a panel of 100 might seem low.  Does this difference (8% vs. 3%) seem big to you? Do you think this could be due to chance?**\n",

Some people claimed that the overall percentage disparity (between 8% and 3%) was small and reflected no attempt to include or exclude \"a specified number of Black people from the jury.\" They claimed this \"small\" difference could simply be due to chance.  Critics and Smith claimed that the system of jury selection caused the lack of fair and reasonable representation of Black people on the jury.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Puzzle 1.1: Writing a Function\n",

    "Let’s do a simulation in Python to understand what’s going on.  We will eventually write a simulation to show the expected distribution.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, from the case: we're trying to see if the difference between 8% and 3% is small and reflects no attempt to include or exclude \"a specified number of Black people.\"  In other words, we want to **write a function** to **randomly sample 100 people from a population that is 8% Black**. The function should `return` the **number of Black people in the simulated jury**.  We can do this multiple times and see how rare it is to get 3 or fewer Black people in the jury.\n",

We believe that there is no discrimination based on how the applicants' names sound. Data shows that apparently, resumes with \"white sounding\" names were called back for an interview 10.06% of the time while the \"black sounding\" names were called back for an interview 6.78% of the time. We created a simulation that takes 8.47% of resumes from \"white sounding\" and \"black sounding\". Then, we calculated the call back rate by dividing the call back mean for each respective group by the total number of resumes submitted by each respective group. From there we were able to see the mean for each group and found that the \"white sounding\" group had a call back average of 8.47% and the \"black sounding\" group had an average of 8.46%. Based on these findings, we do not see a significant difference from both averages therefore we do not believe that there is discrimination based on how an applicants' name sounds. "
